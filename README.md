Ideas:

Interactive tiles that have clickable titles or interactive content.
Tile areas that contain different tiles that are alike in type.
Tile areas can become tiles themselves as a sort of layered effect on devices where screen isnt large enough to display full tile area effectively.
Featured/Near you.
Nudge-O-Meter displays party insanity level based on parties you have attended, and based on features party hosts specify.
Possible dimming of tiles around the tile that is being hovered on? Creating a nice layered effect.
  -Blurring of tiles?
  -Maybe only add the effect once clicked
Definitely some form of filter for finding things near you that uses larger tile to display toggles
single tiles + double tiles
  -not sure how to display information in a simple manner to fit tile theme

Colors:

I think we need to get some outside opinions on color options. We would need to make some form of survey to see which colors people look for in a website or app of this nature that would be for the purpose we have. --Jacob
